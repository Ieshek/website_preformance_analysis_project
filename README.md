# ðŸ“˜ Project Title: Website Performance Analysis
# ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the performance of a website using data-driven metrics such as load time, bounce rate, traffic sources, and user engagement. The goal is to identify performance bottlenecks and provide actionable recommendations to enhance speed, SEO efficiency, and user experience.


This notebook performs website performance analysis using Python. Here's a brief summary of what the code does:

Libraries Imported:
It uses pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

Data Loading and Cleaning:

Loads a CSV file (data-export (1).csv) containing website analytics data.

Adjusts the header by assigning the first row as column names.

Drops the initial row and resets the DataFrame index.

Renames columns for clarity, including metrics like:

channel group

Users, Sessions, Engaged sessions

Engagement rate, Event count, etc.

The rest of the notebook likely includes analysis and visualizations of this performance data (e.g., trends, comparisons, engagement metrics). If you'd like, I can go further and summarize the full notebook's logic and outputs.
